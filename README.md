# Welcome to Wayventure's development branch!

### NOTE: The project is currently halted for a month or two while I study deeper into C++

### Please only try to compile the released versions, I usually commit broken code

### Installation instructions:
Dependencies for compilation: A C++ compiler, [libtcod (Version 1.19.0-alpha)](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod), [SDL2 (Version 2.0.16)](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)  
I apologize for not being able to statically compile it since I can't figure out why it is SegFaulting. If you are able to statically compile the entire program, please open an issue or discussion and share how you managed it. Thanks!

If you're proficient in C++ and use Linux, I've prepared a cmake script for easier compiling.

I sincerely apologize for the inconvinience you have to go through to test my program.
## Issues/Feature Requests
Please open an issue if you found any bugs or simply just want to give suggestions about the gameplay!
- For current TODOs please refer to our [kanban board](https://app.gitkraken.com/glo/board/YVe6OSzWtwBMT89r).

(Due to the heavy development this game is currently undergoing, I will only be writing the Wiki after I've released all the base features)
