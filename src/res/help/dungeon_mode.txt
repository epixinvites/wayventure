'w', 'a', 's', 'd' to move around
'z' to interact with doors
'x' to attack enemies / interact with NPCs
'c' to interact with staircases ('>' and '<')
'r' to redraw the entire screen, in case you messed something up
'i' to invoke your backpack (accessible when you have obtained your first item)
'e' to choose whether to eat or to drink
'.' to rest at the expense of your saturation
'S' to save your data (data will still be automatically saved on quit)
'q' to exit the game

Characters you see on screen:
'@' are either you or NPCs (which are interactable using 'x')
    NOTE: There are some NPCs in the Pub where I haven't programmed yet
'x' are normal enemies, they get tougher as you venture deeper into the dungeon
'X' are room bosses, level bosses or final bosses
    I do not recommend you fighting them without good gear
